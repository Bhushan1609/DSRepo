# Solving Striver's DSA Sheet

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bhushan Thombare, and I'm on a journey to conquer data structures and algorithms through Striver's comprehensive DSA course.

## About the Repository

In this repository, I am tackling Striver's DSA Sheet 2, a curated collection of problems designed to strengthen foundational skills in algorithms and data structures.

## Languages Used

I'm solving these problems in three languages to broaden my proficiency:

- **C++**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript**

## Resources

- **Striver's DSA Course:** [Sheet 2](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)

## Goals

My goal is not just to solve these problems but to understand the underlying concepts deeply. I believe in continuous learning and improvement.
